Trivy scanner 
--------------------
-->it perform scanning for docker images 
-->it scan vulnerability of image 
docker vulnerability scanning it is  the process of identifyieng security vulnerabilities for packages utilized in a dockr image
this process is allow you to detect vulnerabilities in images before deploying or running them
these vulnerabilities can be patched or fixed in order to make the image as secure as possible
this is very important aspect of docker security, primarly because all the security measures we have implemented can be usurped by a vulnerability in one of the packages 

--------------------------------------------
introduction to trivy 
trivy is a simple and comprehensive scaner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems , and git repositories, as well as for configuration issues. 
trivy can be used to scan infrastrucher as code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and kubernetes, to detect potetial configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attacks
we can use Trivy to scan Dockerfile for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that could potentialy lead to exploitation or data exposure. 
===================
Practical
On docker host machine
To work scanning to image trivay scan and image(tomee) must be local to scan image
# docker pull aquasec/trivy
-->above command to pull trivy image into local

-->To run trivy in system 
#docker run aquasec/trivy


-->take any image from dockerhub
# docker pull hackersploit/bwapp-docker
-->to scan image it shoud be locally first 
example:
docker run --rm -v trivy :/root/.cache aquasec/trivy  hackersploit/bwapp-docker 
--------------
# docker run --rm aquasec/trivy 

# docker run --rm  aquasec/trivy  image  ubuntu:18.04
-->above command scanning ubuntu image

# docker run --rm aquesec/trivy  image  tomee
-->above command will scan tomee
==================================

To dowload trivy in system 
#docker run aquasec/trivy
# docker run --rm aquesec/trivy  image  hackersploit/bwapp-docker
=======================
# docker run --rm  aquasec/trivy image navathej408/mysuperapp
==================================
stage("sacn image from trivyscan"){
            steps{
                script{
                    sh 'docker pull aquasec/trivy'
                    sh 'docker run --rm aquasec/trivy image "${IMAGE_NAME}"'
                }
            }
        }
