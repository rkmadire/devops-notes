Git Merge and merge conflicts 
	
  1. Git merge

	- git merge it is a command in git 
	- it used to combine changes from one branch to anothe branch 
	- typically when we want to integrate features or fixes the from different branches into main or devlopement branch 

		# git merge branch_name 

  2. Git merge Conflicts 

  	- Merge Conflicts will comes when Git is unable to resolve the differences b/w branches 
  	- this typically happens when 
  		- Two or more branches modify the same line in a file differently.
  		- A file is deleted in one branch but modified in another.
  		- A file is added to both branches with different content.
  	- we need Require you to manually resolve the conflicts.

Sample Example Git merge Conflict
-----------------------------------

	- Step-by-Step Example of a Merge Conflict

	1. nitialize a Git Repository
	   ```bash
	   mkdir my-repo
	   cd my-repo
	   git init
	   ```

	2. Create a file and make an initial commit
	   ```bash
	   echo "Hello, world!" > file.txt
	   git add file.txt
	   git commit -m "Initial commit"
	   ```

	3. Create a new branch and make changes
	   ```bash
	   git checkout -b feature-branch
	   echo "This is a feature." >> file.txt
	   git add file.txt
	   git commit -m "Add feature"
	   ```

	4. Switch back to the main branch and make conflicting changes
	   ```bash
	   git checkout main
	   echo "This is a conflicting change." >> file.txt
	   git add file.txt
	   git commit -m "Add conflicting change"
	   ```

	5. Attempt to merge the feature branch into the main branch
	   ```bash
	   git merge feature-branch
	   ```

	6. Resolve the merge conflict
	   You will see a message indicating a conflict. Open `file.txt` to find the conflict markers:
	   ```
	   <<<<<<< HEAD
	   Hello, world!
	   This is a conflicting change.
	   =======
	   This is a feature.
	   >>>>>>> feature-branch
	   ```

	   Edit the file to resolve the conflict:
	   ```txt
	   Hello, world!
	   This is a feature.
	   This is a conflicting change.
	   ```

	7. Stage the resolved file and complete the merge
	   ```bash
	   git add file.txt
	   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
	   ```
