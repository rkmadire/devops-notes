ECR (elastic container registry) 18:00 min docker 12th session
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is ECR

	- ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is a fully managed container registry in AWS.
	- It allows you to store, manage, and deploy Docker images.
	- Supports both public & private repositories.

2. Steps to Upload a Docker Image to ECR
	
	Step 1: Create an IAM Role for EC2

		- Go to AWS IAM → Roles → Create Role
		- Select AWS Service → EC2 → Next
		- Attach AdministratorAccess policy
		- Name the role (e.g., ecr_role1) → Create role
		- Attach this role to your EC2 instance
			- Go to EC2 → Instances → Actions → Security → Modify IAM Role
			- Select ecr_role1 and attach it.

	Step 2: Create an ECR Repository

		- Go to AWS ECR → Create Repository
		- Select "Private"
		- Enter repository name (e.g., nginx12)
		- Click "Create Repository"
		- after creating repository it will provide set of commands to upload local image into ECR those commands will find view push commands inside repository  

	step3: Step 3: Install AWS CLI & Log in to ECR

		-  First, install AWS CLI on your EC2 instance (if not already installed):

			# apt install awscli -y   # For Ubuntu/Debian

		- Now, log in to AWS ECR:

			# aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 560221225043.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

		- (Replace 560221225043.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com with your ECR repository URL)


	step4: Build and Push the Docker Image

		- To Build image 

			# docker build -t nginx12 .

		- Tag the Image for ECR

			# docker tag nginx12:latest 560221225043.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/nginx12:latest

		- Push the Image to ECR

			# docker push 560221225043.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/nginx12:latest

	Note: Now your image is stored in AWS ECR and can be used for deployments.


3. Some commands 
	- apt install awscli -y (to install awscli in machine)
	- `aws ecr get-login-password --region <region>  (To Log in to AWS ECR)
	- docker build -t <image-name> .  (To build docker image )
	- docker tag <image-name>:latest <ECR-URL>/<image-name>:latest  (to tag docker image )
	- docker push <ECR-URL>/<image-name>:latest  ( To push image to ECR )
