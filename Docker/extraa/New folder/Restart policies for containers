Restart policies for containers
---------------------------------------

1. Several restart policies exist with --restart option that will define how a container should not be restarted on exit 

no
	-> default restart policy 
	-> never restart automatically a container 

always
	-> always restart a container regardless of the exit status of container 

	$ docker run --restart=always my-container

on-failure
	-> Restart a container only when it is exit status due to an error 

	$ docker run --restart=on-failure my-container

Note: we able to limit the number of restart retries to the docker daemon attempts 
		$ docker run --restart=on-failure:5 my-container

unless-stopped
	-> Restart a container unless it was stopped before the docker daemon was restarted 

	$ docker run --restart=unless-stopped my-container

To change the Restart policy for running container
	
	$ docker update --restart=unless-stopped my-container 

Note: Restart policy only takes effect after a container starts successfull

Dispaly the number of restarts for my container
	
	$ docker inspect -f "{{ .RestartCout }}" my-container
