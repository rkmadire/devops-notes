cache in docker
------------------
1. docker image build by dockerfile 
2. dockerfile containe orderwise some instruction to build image out of the dockerfile
3. when initially build docker image with dockerfile it will build docker image and stores layers into cache with those related steps 
4. remember layers are immutable 
5. Now if we want to build another image with same or few changes instructions now docker image will be created using cahche space to build image fastly 
6. FROM instruction doesn't use the cache 

To list all layers for a given image and their size 

	$ docker history my-image --no-trunc

Display layers digest for an image 

	$ docker inspect -f '{{json.RootFS.Layers}}' scraly/simpleapp | jq .
